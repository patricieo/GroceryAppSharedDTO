Took this class to learn full stack iOS development.  The number of topics covered was amazing.  
SwiftUI, Vapor
Deploying a Swift Package to Github.
Integrating the same Swift API package into Server and Client
Postgres
API design.
Authentication,
Cloud Deployment
Having spent years on iOS development this expanded my knowledge of server side development and helped me understand many of the back and forth communications I have had with front/back end 
developers.

Comparison React vs Vapor: 
There is almost an exact comparison between React/Typescript/Node.js 
and Vapor. Vapor provides an interesting alternative to the traditional 
React stack and has all of the same concepts and capabilities.  
In some ways Vapor is better because the IDE XCode is extremely well developed and Swift has a significant lead on Typescript as a fully developed structured language. From my experiments 
with typescript it is extremely similar to swift. Modify a few keywords such as let = var and you have almost the same thing.  As Javascript evolves over time it has in essence the 
desire to become a structured language and that is basically what swift already is.  
The main drawback of Vapor currently -> React has market dominance as a full stack product.  
After examining job postings for developers I did not see any that mentioned Vapor. While many are asking for React.

API Notes: The reason we are adding ResponseDTO's and RequestDTO's in this manner is to have different parameters for both the post to the server and the return to the client.  In a large scale app it may not be desired to limit parameters returned to the client.
