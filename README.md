Took this class to learn full stack iOS development.  The number of topics covered was amazing.  
SwiftUI, Vapor
Deploying a Swift Package to Github.
Integrating the same Swift API package into Server and Client
Postgres
API design.
Authentication,
Cloud Deployment
Having spent years on iOS development this expanded my knowledge of server side development and helped me understand many of the back and forth communications I have had with front end developers.

Notes: 
This class does not cover React or Node.js  Vapor provides an interesting alternative and has all of the same concepts and capabilities.  In some ways Vapor is better because the IDE XCode is extremely well developed and Swift has a significant lead on Typescript as a fully developed structured language.  
The main drawback of Vapor currently is: React has market dominance as a full stack product.

API Notes: The reason we are adding ResponseDTO's and RequestDTO's in this manner is to have different parameters for both the post to the server and the return to the client.  In a large scale app it may not be desired to limit parameters returned to the client.
