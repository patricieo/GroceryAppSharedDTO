Took this class to learn full how to build a server with Swift.  

Notes: 
The reason we are adding ResponseDTO's and RequestDTO's in this manner is to have different parameters for both the post to the server and the return to the client.  In a large scale app It may not be desired to return all of the info back to the client.
